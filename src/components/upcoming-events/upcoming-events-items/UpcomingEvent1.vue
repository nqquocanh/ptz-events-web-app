              If anyone is observed or reported engaging in harassing or unsafe
              behaviour, Zouk It Up staff will take any action we deem
              appropriate. Anyone asked to stop harassing or unsafe behaviour is
              expected to comply immediately. Continued harassing or unsafe
              behaviour may result in expulsion from the event, and potentially
              referral to the police.

              If you ever feel uncomfortable, unsafe, marginalised,
              disrespected, or treated unfairly in our workshops or socials,

              support, confidentiality, take measures to rectify the situation,
              and help you file a report if you wish.
